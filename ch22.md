# chapter 22: reconstruction

__general notes__

key challeges being faced rn: how tf do we bring south back in union? how tf do we rebuild it? how tf do we protect black freedom? what branch of govt should even control reconstruction? should we forgive the southern leaders? wtf???

- big problem 1: how do we help freed blacks?
    - blacks were often unskilled, propertyless, poor, and illiterate
    - but they also just helped win the war
    - Addressed in the Freedmen's Bureau (supposed to helped former slaves & poor southern whites: food/shelter/medical/education) 
      - Taught 200k africans how to read, built many schools 
    - "fourty acres and a mule"
      - the (failed) idea of giving confiscated lands to slaves
    -
