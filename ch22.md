# chapter 22: reconstruction

__general notes__

key challeges being faced rn: how tf do we bring south back in union? how tf do we rebuild it? how tf do we protect black freedom? what branch of govt should even control reconstruction? should we forgive the southern leaders? wtf???

- how do we help freed blacks?
    - blacks were often unskilled, propertyless, poor, and illiterate
    - but they also just helped win the war
    - Addressed in the Freedmen's Bureau (supposed to helped former slaves & poor southern whites: food/shelter/medical/education) 
      - Taught 200k africans how to read, built many schools 
    - "fourty acres and a mule"
      - the (failed) idea of giving confiscated lands to slaves
      - nothing happened, africans still poor
- reconstruction plans     
    - Lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty & Reconstruction: 'wartime reconstruction', plan was to give south an incentive to quit the fight 
        - southern states can rejoin union when 10% of the state voters pledge loyalty to union
        - they also HAVE TO accept emancipation
    - Wade-Davis plan: more strict  
        - 50% of state voters had to take an "iron clad" oath of allegiance
        - If you helped confederate side, you were excluded from new govt
        - pocket veto by lincoln
- lincoln DEAD!
    - Andrew Johnson (southern senator democrat) becomes pres, accepts lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty & Reconstruction *but* southern leaders + southern people who own more than $20k of land lose ability to vote (they can appeal for a pardon tho) and states have to ratify 13th amendment 
    - Johsnon pardons most of the former confederate leaders, pisses off north republicans
        - southern planters get political control of sourthern politics (Former confederate VP Alexander Stephans gets senator of Georgia)
- southern defiance: black codes
    - black codes tried to establish a stable labor supply after emancipation 
        - prevented africans from renting land/borrowing money 
        - forced africans to sign labor contracts, or penalty
        - africans cant serve on a jury or vote 
    - forced africans to be sharecroppers (this sounds familiar!!)
- president johnson v congress 
    - north republicans mad that confederates back in office, leads to stricter reconstruction where congress takes over  
    - congress says NO to confederates coming back
    - johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau extension, congress overrides 
    - civil rights bill: gives citizenship to africans, got rid of black codes
       - Johnson vetoes, but bill still passed
*note: republicans control congess,  Radicals v Moderates*  
- congress: how can we stop south from overturning laws we pass for reconstruction? 14th amendment?
    - said all people born in US are citizens 
    - said states HAVE to protect person rights and provide "equal protection of the law" and "due process"
    - preventing former confederates from holding office
    - southern states would be punished for denying right to vote for black citizens 
- Reconstruction act of 1867 divided south into 5 military districted (UNION CONTROLLED)  
    - no right to vote for former confederates
    - to be readmitted as a state, new state constitution would need to be made INCLUDING black suffrage 
- JOHSNON IMPEACHED (1ST IMPEACHED PRESIDENT LOL L BOZO)  
    - 1867 tenure of office act reduced president power, protected republican reconstruction cabinet
        - said the senate has to approve of any presedential dismissal of a cabinet official or general
    - Johnson violates this when removing Sec of War Stanton, goes to house for impeachment, misses the 2/3 vote by one vote, leaving him still in office 
- 15th amendment 
    - universal male suffrage, right to vote can't be denied due to race, color, or previous condition of servitude
